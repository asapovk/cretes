7	Strangeness production with ALICE at the LHC	The main goal of the ALICE experiment is to study the physics of strongly interacting matter under extremely high temperature and energy density conditions to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon plasma (QGP). The enhanced production of strange hadrons with respect to non-strange particles was historically considered as one of the signatures of QGP formation during the evolution of the system created in heavy-ion collisions. The excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities of the ALICE experiment allow the reconstruction of multi-strange baryons via their weak decay channels over a large range of transverse momentum. In this talk the yields and the relative production rates of strange and multi-strange particles normalized to pions measured in pp, p-Pb, Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions will be presented as a function of particle multiplicity. The strangeness production dependence on the collision energy will also be shown. Results will be compared to QCD-inspired and statistical hadronization model predictions.    .	2019-08-26 08:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Maria Vasileiou	
13	Targeted cancer therapy with the alpha emitter actinium-225	The targeted treatment of cancerous tumors by alpha-emitting radionuclides has shown remarkable efficacy in recent clinical trials [1]. It is likely that this treatment option will ultimately be applicable to a wide range of cancers and other diseases, subject to the development of specific carrier molecules.  Currently Ac-225 is being produced from natural ingrowth in existing stocks of Th-229. However, future wide application for radiotherapy will require many orders of magnitude more radionuclide than can currently be produced. Consequently, following up on earlier work at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) [2], we are pursuing various alternative production methods. In this paper, an overview of internal radiotherapy with alpha emitters is given, along with recent clinical experience, as well as possible schemes for the large-scale production of Ac-225 using different target materials and irradiation facilities.

15	Directional Dark Matter Search with Nuclear Emulsion	A variety of experiments have been developed over the past decades, aiming to detect Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) via their scattering in a detector medium. The  sensitivity  of  these  experiments  has improved  with  a  tremendous  speed  due  to  a  constant  development  of  the  detectors and analysis methods. Detectors that are able to reconstruct the direction of the nucleus recoiling against the scattering WIMP are opening a new frontier to possibly extend Dark Matter searches beyond the neutrino background. Exploiting directionality would also give a proof of the galactic origin of dark matter making it possible to have a clear and unambiguous signal to background separation.  The NEWSdm experiment, based on nuclear emulsions, is proposed to measure the direction of WIMP-induced nuclear recoils. We discuss  the potentiality, both in terms of exclusion limits and potential discovery, of a directional experiment based on the use of a solid target made by newly developed nuclear emulsions and read-out systems reaching sub-micrometric resolution. We also report results of the test exposure conducted in Gran Sasso last year.	2019-08-26 13:50:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Antonia Di Crescenzo	
17	Developments for pulsed antihydrogen production towards direct gravitational measurement on antimatter	A main scientific goal of the $AE\bar{g}IS$ experiment is the direct measurement of the Earth's local gravitational acceleration $g$ on antihydrogen. The weak equivalence principle is a foundation of General Relativity. It has been extensively tested with ordinary matter but very little is known about the gravitational interaction between matter and antimatter. Antihydrogen is produced in $AE\bar{g}IS$ via resonant charge exchange reactions between cold Rydberg-excited positronium and cooled down antiprotons. The  achievements towards the development of a pulsed cold antihydrogen source are presented.     Large number of antiprotons, necessary for a significant production rate of antihydrogen, are captured, accumulated, compressed and cooled down over an extended period of time. Positronium (Ps) is formed through $e^+$-Ps conversion in a silica porous target at 10 K temperature in a reflection geometry inside the main apparatus. The so-formed Ps cloud is then laser-excited to Rydberg levels leading to the first Ps laser excitation to the Rydberg levels in a 1T magnetic field and to the detailed characterisation of the Ps source for antihydrogen production.     Several detection techniques are extensively used to monitor antiproton and positron manipulations in the formation process of antihydrogen inside the main apparatus. Positronium detection techniques underwent extensive improvements in sensitivity in 2018. At the same time, major efforts to improve integrate and commission the various detector sensitive to antihydrogen production took place. These include an array of external scintillators and a scintillating fiber based tracking detector. Measurements based on this improved detection system will be presented.	2019-08-26 12:40:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Mattia Fanì	
21	Optics and magnetic fields for fundamental physics	In recent years precision optics together with strong magnetic fields have become key ingredients for fundamental physics experiments searching, for example, for vacuum magnetic birefringence and for axions and/or axion-like particles. Vacuum magnetic birefringence (polarisation dependent refractive index) is a macroscopic non-linear electrodynamic effect in vacuum predicted as a consequence of the formulation of the Euler-Kockel-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian, first proposed in 1935, which takes into account electron-positron fluctuations. A direct laboratory observation of vacuum magnetic birefringence is still lacking today due to its minute value: ∆n = 4x10e-24 @ B = 1T. Axions and axion-like particles are light neutral hypothetical bosons which could couple to two photons through the Primakoff effect. The existence of these hypothetical particles could solve the strong CP problem and are good dark matter candidates. I will describe some recent experimental results and proposals regarding these two areas of research. Key experimental ingredients in such researches are a Fabry-Perot interferometer, an intense magnetic field and a time-dependent effect.	2019-08-23 12:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Future of Fundamental Physics		Guido Zavattini	
22	Final results of the CUPID-0 Phase I experiment	A convincing observation of neutrino-less double beta decay (0νDBD) relies on the possibility of operating high-energy resolution detectors in background-free conditions.    Scintillating cryogenic calorimeters are one of the most promising tools to fulfill the requirements for a next-generation experiment. Several steps have been taken to demonstrate the maturity of this technique, starting form the successful experience of CUPID-0.    The CUPID-0 experiment collected 10 kg*y of exposure, running 26 Zn82Se crystals during two years of continuous detector operation. The complete rejection of the dominant alpha background was demonstrated, measuring the lowest counting rate in the region of interest for this technique. Furthermore, the most stringent limit on the Se-82 0νDBD was established.    In this contribution we present the final results of CUPID-0 Phase I, including a detailed model of the background and the measurement of the 2νDBD half-life.	2019-08-22 08:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity		Chiara Brofferio	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3535393/attachments/1895827/3127719/Brofferio_ICNFP_2019.pdf
25	Measurement of $\rm D$-meson production and flow in Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC	Open-charmed mesons are unique tools to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. Charm quarks, due to their large mass, are produced in hard partonic scattering processes in the initial stages of the collision. Therefore, they experience all the phases of the QGP evolution propagating through the medium and interacting with its constituents.    The measurement of $\rm D$-meson nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$, defined as the ratio of the measured yield in nucleus-nucleus collisions to the one in proton-proton interactions scaled by the average number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, provides information on the interactions of charm quarks with the medium, in particular on their energy loss. The study of $\rm D$-meson elliptic flow, the second-harmonic coefficient of the Fourier decomposition of the particle momentum-azimuthal distribution with respect to the reaction plane, at low transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}$ can give insight into the participation of charm quarks in the collective expansion of the system and their possible thermalization in the medium. At high $p_{\rm T}$ it allows us to assess the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. These two observables can also shed light on possible modifications of charm-quark hadronization in the medium. In fact, the comparison of the yields  of $\rm D$-meson species with and without strange-quark content permits us to study the role of the recombination mechanism for charm quarks.      In this talk, the latest results on the $p_{\rm T}$-differential $R_{\rm AA}$ and flow of $\rm D^0$, $\rm D^+$, $\rm D^{*+}$ and $\rm D_s^+$ mesons measured at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV obtained by the ALICE Collaboration will be presented for different centrality classes. The measurements exploit the large data sample collected with ALICE at the end of 2018 and also improved analysis methods based on machine learning techniques. The comparison of the results with model predictions will be discussed as well.	2019-08-24 08:25:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Fabio Catalano	
26	Particle production in modified gravity in the early and in the present day universe	Gravitational equations of motion in modified theories of gravity have oscillating solutions, both in the early and in the present day universe. Particle production by such oscillations is analysed and possible observational consequences are considered. This phenomenon has impact on energy spectrum of cosmic rays and abundance of dark matter particles.	2019-08-28 14:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Elena Arbuzova	
32	Recent results from LHCb	In this talk we will highlight recent results from LHCb with a focus on measurements of CP violation in b and c decays and measurements testing Lepton Flavor Universality at LHCb .    The most recent results on CP violation in the decay, mixing and interference of both b and c hadrons obtained by the LHCb Collaboration with Run I and years 2015-2016 of Run II are reviewed. In particular world best constraints and world first measurements are provided for CKM elements, unitarity angles and charm parameters.    The concept of lepton universality, where the muon and tau particles are simply heavier copies of the electron, is a key prediction in the Standard Model (SM). In models beyond the SM, lepton universality can be naturally violated with new physics particles that couple preferentially to the second and third generation leptons. Over the last few years, several hints of lepton universality violation have been seen in both b->c and b->s semileptonic beauty decays. This presentation will review these anomalies and give an outlook for the near future. Other probes of NP in highly suppressed b-hadron decays will also be discussed.	2019-08-26 06:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	LHC Plenary Session		Stefania Vecchi	
34	ATLAS Transverse Missing Momentum Trigger Performance	Transverse missing momentum from non-interacting particles is one of the important characteristics for many analyses especially for Beyond Standard Model physics searches. To study these events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with the ATLAS experiment an efficient trigger selection is needed. The ATLAS transverse missing momentum trigger uses calorimeter-based global energy sums together with specifically developed pile-up mitigation techniques. The high number of pile-up interactions was one of the major challenges faced during Run 2 and a continuous effort was needed to improve the pile-up rejection and to keep the trigger rate reasonable. This talk presents the techniques used to improve the Run 2 transverse missing momentum trigger performance, the full Run 2 performance and an outlook on further improvements for Run 3.	2019-08-26 15:30:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Mini Workshop on Instruments and Methods in HEP		Gabriel Gallardo	
35	ATLAS Muon Trigger performance	Events containing muons in the final state are an important signature for many analyses being carried out at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), including both standard model measurements and searches for new physics. To be able to study such events, it is required to have an efficient and well-understood muon trigger. The ATLAS muon trigger consists of a hardware-based system (Level 1), as well as a software-based reconstruction (High Level Trigger). Due to the high luminosity in Run 2, several improvements have been implemented to keep the trigger rate low, while still maintaining high efficiency. Some examples of recent improvements include requiring coincidence of hits in the muon spectrometer and the calorimeter and optimized muon isolation. We will present an overview of how we trigger on muons, recent improvements, the performance of the muon trigger in Run-2 data and an outlook for the improvements planned for run-3.	2019-08-28 13:30:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Andrea Ventura	
36	The ATLAS Level-1 Topological Processor: experience and upgrade plans	During Run-2 the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has provided, at the World's energy frontier, proton-proton collisions to the ATLAS experiment with high instantaneous luminosity (up to 2.1x10^34 cm^-2s^-1), placing stringent operational and physical requirements on the ATLAS trigger system in order to reduce the 40 MHz collision rate to a manageable event storage rate of 1 kHz, while not rejecting interesting collisions.     The Level-1 trigger is the first rate-reducing step in the ATLAS trigger system with an output rate of up to 100 kHz and decision latency of less than 2.5 microseconds. Until the end of 2018, an important role was played by the Level 1 Topological Processor (L1Topo). This innovative system consists of two blades designed in AdvancedTCA form factor, mounting four individual state-of-the-art processors, and providing high input bandwidth and low latency data processing. Up to 128 topological trigger algorithms can be implemented to select interesting events by applying kinematic and angular requirements on electromagnetic clusters, hadronic jets, muons and total energy reconstructed in the ATLAS apparatus. This resulted in a significantly improved background event rejection rate and improved acceptance of physics signal events, despite the increasing luminosity. The L1Topo system has become more and more important for physics analyses making use of low energy objects, commonly present in the Heavy Flavour or Higgs physics events for example.     In this presentation, an overview of the L1Topo architecture, simulation, and performance results during Run-2 is discussed alongside with upgrade plans for the L1Topo system to be installed for the future data taking that will start in 2021.	2019-08-26 15:05:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Mini Workshop on Instruments and Methods in HEP		Carlos Moreno Martinez	
37	The ATLAS Electron and Photon Trigger Performance in Run 2	ATLAS electron and photon triggers covering transverse energies from 5 GeV to several TeV are essential to record signals for a wide variety of physics: from Standard Model processes to searches for new phenomena in both proton-proton and heavy ion collisions. Main triggers used during Run 2 (2015-2018) for those physics studies were a single-electron trigger with ET threshold around 25 GeV and a diphoton trigger with thresholds at 25 and 35 GeV. Relying on those simple, general-purpose triggers is seen as a more robust trigger strategy, at a cost of slightly higher trigger output rates, than to use a large number of analysis-specific triggers. To cope with ever-increasing luminosity and more challenging pile-up conditions at the LHC, the trigger selections needed to be optimized to control the rates and keep efficiencies high. The ATLAS electron and photon performance during Run-2 data-taking is presented as well as work ongoing to prepare to even higher luminosity of Run 3 (2021-2023).	2019-08-26 13:50:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Mini Workshop on Instruments and Methods in HEP		Daniela Maria Koeck	
40	Status of the GERDA Phase II experiment.	The GERDA (GERmanium Detector Array) experiment, located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy, is one of the leading experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ). Bare semiconductor detectors made of germanium enriched in Ge-76 isotope are operated in a cryostat filled with liquid argon. In Phase II of the experiment 35.6 kg of enriched germanium detectors are deployed. Application of active background rejection methods, such as a liquid argon scintillation light read-out and pulse shape discrimination of detector signals, allowed to reduce the background index to less than 10^-3 cts/(keV·kg·yr). The half-life sensitivity for 0νββ decay achieved by GERDA Phase II overpassed 10^26 years first time ever. Recently the hardware upgrade of the experiment has been performed. At the conference the status of GERDA Phase II after the upgrade will be presented.	2019-08-27 12:40:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Nadezda  Rumyantseva	
43	Search for critical effects in NA61/SHINE	NA61/SHINE is a multi-purpose experiment to study hadron-proton, hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. The experiment performs unique measurements for the physics of strong interactions as well as important reference measurements for neutrino and cosmic-ray physics.    The primary goals of the experiment are the study of the onset of deconfinement and the search for the critical point of the strongly interacting matter, to uncover the mechanism of thermalisation and to test the validity of statistical models. For this purpose, a two-dimensional scan was performed by varying the beam momentum (13$A$-158$A$ GeV/$c$) and the size of colliding systems (p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb).    Recent NA61/SHINE results on the search for critical effects in spectra and fluctuations including an indication for the onset of thermalisation with an increasing nuclear mass number of the colliding nuclei - the onset of fireball, and a hint of intermittent fluctuations of protons    in collisions of medium size nuclei at the top SPS energy will be presented within this contribution.	2019-08-28 15:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC		Magdalena Kuich	
48	Effect of Rope Hadronization in Stangeness Enhancement and Two particle correlations in p-p collisions at LHC energies.	The p$-$p collisions at high multiplicity at LHC show small scale    collective effects similar to that observed in heavy ion collisions    such as enhanced production of strange and multi-strange hadrons, long range azimuthal correlations, etc.    The observation of strangeness enhancement in p$-$p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV  and 13 TeV as measured by ALICE experimentis explored using Pythia8 event generator within the framework of microscopic rope hadronization model which assumes the formation of ropes due to overlapping of strings in high multiplicity environment.    The transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectra shape and its hardening with    multiplicity is well described by the model. The mechanism of    formation of ropes with QCD-based color reconnections also described    the observed experimental strangeness enhancement for higher multiplicity classes in p$-$p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and 13 TeV.  The enhancement with multiplicity is further investigated by studying the mean $p_{T}$ ($<p_{T}>$) and the integrated yields ($<dN/dy>$ ) of strange and multi-strange hadrons and comparing the predictions to the measured data at  LHC for 7 TeV and13 TeV.  The mechanism has also been checked for two particle correlation to see the near side ridge effect and the    resonance produciton for p$-$p collisions at 7 TeV and 13 TeV	2019-08-24 08:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Sadhana Dash	
49	Experimental progress towards positronium Bose-Einstein condensation	Positronium (Ps), the bound state of an electron and a positron, is one of the best candidates for the first Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of antimatter system. Ps-BEC can be regarded as an “antimatter laser”, which has rich potential for applications to both fundamental and applied physics. For example, the gravitational effect on antimatter can be studied by constructing a Mach-Zehnder interferometer of Ps-BEC. Gamma-ray laser can also be realized using annihilation gamma-rays from Ps-BEC.       The challenge to realize Ps-BEC is to create dense (> 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$) and cold (< 10 K) Ps atoms in a short lifetime of Ps (142 ns). To achieve these target values, we proposed the following new scheme. Firstly, dense Ps atoms are formed in small (~ 10$^6$ nm$^3$) pores in a silica (SiO$_2$) target by bombarding focused and bunched positron beams. Then, Ps atoms are rapidly cooled to ~300 K by thermalization caused by collisions with pore walls. Finally, Ps are cooled to less than 10 K by laser cooling which uses 243 nm 1S-2P transitions. Monte Carlo simulation shows that this method can realize Ps-BEC in ~300 ns after Ps formation.       We are currently trying laser cooling of Ps at KEK slow positron facility (SPF). In this presentation, I will show the overall development status and future prospects of our experiment, especially about the following topics: positron fusing system using multi-stage brightness enhancement system, Ps generator/condenser/cooler target material, and special home-made 243 nm pulsed laser system for Ps cooling.

54	Gapped Continuum Kaluza-Klein spectrum	In this work we consider a warped five-dimensional model with an ultraviolet (UV) brane and, on top of the Standard Model zero modes, continua of KK modes with different mass gaps for all particles: gauge bosons, fermions, graviton, radion and Higgs boson. The model can be considered as a modelization in five dimensions of gapped unparticles. It has a singularity, at a finite (infinite) value of the proper (conformal) coordinate, which is admissible as it supports finite temperature in the form of a black hole horizon. An infrared (IR) brane, with particular jumping conditions, is introduced to trigger correct electroweak breaking. The gravitational metric is AdS$_5$ near the UV brane, to solve the hierarchy problem with a fundamental Planck scale, and linear, in conformal coordinates, near the IR, as in the linear dilaton and five-dimensional clockwork models. The branes, and singularity, distances are fixed, a la Goldberger-Wise, by a bulk scalar field with brane potentials explicitly breaking the conformal symmetry. We have computed the spectral functions and arbitrary Green's functions and shown how they can modify some Standard Model processes. This work is based on [1].

58	Solar Neutrino Physics with Borexino	The Sun offers us the opportunity to make detailed observations of the exterior and interior of a typical star in its mid-life phase. A unique way to study the innermost regions of our star is offered by solar neutrinos, emitted by the thermonuclear fusion reactions in the Sun. The **Borexino experiment**, located in  Laboratori Nazionali del GranSasso in Italy and widely known for its rich Solar Neutrino physics program, is now in his high-purity Phase II, thanks to intense purification campaigns of scintillator that were very successful in further reducing the already low backgrounds, leading to unprecedented radiopurity levels reached in its active volume (<10^19 g/g for 238U/232Th chains).    In this talk I will review the latest result released, the first simultaneous measurement of the neutrino interaction rates from the proton-proton chain, and I will present the **strategies for measuring the neutrino flux from the CNO cycle**, the last one not yet measured.  The detection of these neutrinos has important implications in astrophysics, as it would be the first direct evidence of the nuclear process that is believed to fuel massive stars.    Despite the unprecedented low levels of background reached in the detector,  the CNO solar neutrinos detection remains a very challenging task because of the almost degenerate spectral shapes of the signal due to CNO neutrinos and the 210Bi background, so that spectral fits are not able to disentangle the two contributions.  A realistic measurement of CNO neutrinos can be performed only using a multivariate spectral fit supported by a sensitive pulse shape discrimination. The 210Bi background can be reduced by further purifications of the scintillator, but anyway it must be also constrained independently by measuring the rate of decay of the daughter nucleus, the 210Po. The difficulty of this analysis lies both in the low signal to noise ratio and in the contamination of the 210Po in the vessel, which diffuses towards the center of the detector. Such transport was strongly suppressed after the detector was equipped with thermal insulation yet this effect remains non-negligible.	2019-08-27 13:50:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Chiara Ghiano	
61	Neutrino CP Violation with the European Spallation Source neutrino Super Beam project	**Title: Neutrino CP Violation with the European Spallation Source neutrino Super Beam project.**     After measuring in 2012 a relatively large value of the neutrino mixing angle θ13, the door is now open to observe for the first time a possible CP violation in the leptonic sector. The measured value of θ13 also privileges the 2nd oscillation maximum for the discovery of CP violation instead of the usually used 1st oscillation maximum. The sensitivity at this 2nd oscillation maximum is about three times higher than for the 1st oscillation maximum inducing a lower influence of systematic errors.Going to the 2nd oscillation maximum necessitates a very intense neutrino beam with the appropriate energy. The world’s most intense pulsed spallation neutron source, the European Spallation Source, will have aproton linac with 5 MW power and 2 GeV energy. This linac, under construction, alsohas the potential to become the proton driver of the world’s most intense neutrino beam with very high potential to discover a neutrino CP violation. The physics performance of that neutrino Super Beam in conjunction with a megaton underground Water Cherenkov neutrino detector installed at a distance of about 500 km from ESS has been evaluated. In addition, the choice of such detector will extent the physics program to proton–decay, atmospheric neutrinos and astrophysics searches. The ESS proton linac upgrades, the accumulator ring needed for proton pulse compression, the target station optimization and the physics potential are described. In addition to neutrinos, this facility will also produce at the same time a copious number of muons which could be used by a muon collider. The ESS neutron facilitywill be fully ready by 2023 at which moment the upgrades for the neutrino facility could start.    This project is supported by the COST Action CA15139 "Combining forces for a novel European facility for neutrino-antineutrino symmetry-violation discovery"and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 777419.	2019-08-22 12:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Georgios Fanourakis	
63	Space-time structure may be topological and not geometrical	In a previous effort we have created a framework that explains why topological structures naturally arise within a scientific theory; namely, they capture the requirements of experimental verification. This is particularly interesting because topological structures are at the foundation of geometrical structures, which play a fundamental role within modern mathematical physics. In this talk we will show a set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which those topological structures lead to real quantities and manifolds, which are a typical requirement for geometry. These conditions will provide a physically meaningful procedure that is the physical counter-part of the use of Dedekind cuts in mathematics. We then show that those conditions are unlikely to be met at Planck scale, leading to a breakdown of the concept of ordering. This would indicate that the mathematical structures required to describe space-time at that scale, while still topological, may not be geometrical.	2019-08-24 09:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Gabriele Carcassi	
64	Studying Jet Fragmentation and Hadronization at LHCb	New results on jet fragmentation measurements at LHCb are presented. LHCb has probed the fragmentation of light and heavy flavour jets, with results showing significant discrepancies with theoretical predictions found using standard Monte Carlo event simulation. These are the first measurements of jet hadronisation and fragmentation at forward rapidities at the LHC. Results from LHCb of J/Psi production inside jets also provide a new handle on long-standing puzzles on accurately predicting J/Psi production in hadronic collisions.	2019-08-26 13:55:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session on B physics at LHC		Christine Aidala	
68	DAMA/LIBRA–phase2 results and implications on several Dark Matter scenarios	The model independent results on the investigation of the dark matter annual modulation signature by DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 will be outlined, and their  implications on several Dark Matter scenarios will be presented. Thanks to the increased exposure and to the lower software energy threshold, corollary model-dependent analyses permit to significantly restrict the allowed regions for the parameters spaces of various dark matter candidates and astrophysical, particle and nuclear physics scenarios.	2019-08-26 12:00:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Vincenzo Caracciolo	
69	Overview of the PHENIX Spin Program	Over a decade, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has provided unique data for the research of proton spin, thanks to its capability of polarized proton – proton (p + p) and polarized proton – ion (p + A) collisions. As a part of RHIC and its spin program, the PHENIX experiment has explored many interesting and unique probes for the better understanding of the proton spin. In this talk, the overview of the PHENIX Spin Program will be presented, concentrating on recent RHIC runs from 2012-2015, for various collision energies, spin orientations (longitudinal or transverse), and collision systems.	2019-08-24 08:50:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Chong Kim	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3536091/attachments/1895930/3127899/ckim_icnfp2019.pdf
70	Probing the initial stage with direct photons	The $p_T$ spectrum of direct photons, measured at small $p_T$ in $AA$ collisions,     considerably exceeds the expectations, based on the NLO perturbative calculations. The latter miss the illuminating effect of parton density increase at low $x$ due to the mutual enhancement of the saturation scales in both nuclei.    This effect can be naturally implemented within the dipole formalism, which allows performing calculation even at small $p_T$, that is not reachable with perturbative calculations.    We observe a significant enhancement of the direct photon yield,    apart from the usual Cronin effect in the nuclear modification factor, $R_{AA}$.	2019-08-24 09:15:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Michal Krelina	
80	Performance of the ATLAS RPC detector and L1 Muon Barrel trigger at sqrt{s} = 13 TeV	The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider utilises a trigger system consisting of a first level hardware trigger and a higher level software trigger. The Level-1 muon trigger system selects muon candidates with six transverse momentum thresholds and associate them with a correct LHC bunch crossing. The Level-1 Muon Barrel Trigger uses Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) detectors to generate trigger signals for selecting muon candidates within the pseudorapidity range of up to 1.05. The RPC detectors are arranged in three concentric double layers and consist of 3600 gas volumes, with a total surface of more than 4000 square meters, that operate in a toroidal magnetic field. This contribution will discuss the performance of the RPC detector system and of the Level-1 Muon Barrel trigger during the 2018 data taking period. Measurements of RPC detector response obtained using muon candidates produced in LHC collisions will be presented. Trigger performance and efficiency measurements that are obtained using Z boson decays to a muon pair will be also discussed. Finally, studies of the RPC detector response at different high voltage and threshold settings will be discussed, in the context of expected detector response after the High Luminosity LHC upgrades	2019-08-26 12:00:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Mini Workshop on Instruments and Methods in HEP		Marco Sessa	
81	On the generalised spectral structure of QCD propagators	Local formulations of quantum field theory imply that gauge theory propagators can potentially contain generalised infrared poles. In this talk I will outline the theoretical significance of these components, and report on recent lattice fit results for the gluon propagator.	2019-08-22 16:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on QCD		Peter Lowdon	
85	Quantum Phase Transitions on the Hexagonal Lattice	Graphene, a system of carbon atoms arranged on a two dimensional hexagonal lattice, has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental research in the past decade, due to its unique electronic properties. The special symmetries of its electronic band structure lead to an effective description in terms of a massless Dirac field, and strong inter-electron interactions, which can be tuned through various experimental techniques, drive quantum phase transitions to different gapped electronic ordered phases. The phase diagram of interacting fermions on a hexagonal lattice can be studied from first principles using Hybrid-Monte-Carlo simulations. Here, the present status of these efforts is reported.		30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Lattice and Condensed Matter Physics		Dominik Smith	
86	Quantum Monte Carlo study of the renormalization of the Fermi velocity in graphene	We report the results of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations of graphene at large-scale lattices. In our study we accessed small enough temperatures and momenta to confirm the logarithmic divergence of the Fermi velocity at low energies in the non-perturbative regime. It appears that our QMC results lie in between predictions made by one-loop lattice perturbation theory (which substantially overestimates the effect) and Random Phase Approximation (RPA). We also probed the influence of short-range interactions on the long-range behavior of the Fermi velocity, by performing QMC calculations with the same long-range Coulomb tail but different cutoffs for the potentials at short distances.		30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Lattice and Condensed Matter Physics		Maksim Ulybyshev	
95	Recent results on bottomonia and bottomonium-like particles at Belle	The large data sample accumulated by the Belle experiment at KEKB    asymmetric energy e^+ e^- collider provides opportunities to study    bottomonia and bottomonium-like exotic particles. In this presentation,    we report recent results on these topics from Belle, including a new    measurement of the e^+e^-\to \Upsilon(nS)\pi^+\pi^- (n=1,2,3) cross    sections at energies from 10.52 to 11.02 GeV, and observation of    ϒ(2S)→γ ηb(1S), ϒ(4S) → η'ϒ(1S) and e+e-→π+π-π0χb1,2(1P).	2019-08-27 12:20:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Aleksei Garmash	
98	Main results of the DAMPE space detector in its 4th year in orbit	The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a high-performance space particle detector launched in orbit in 2015 by a collaboration of Chinese, Italian and Swiss scientific institutions, coordinated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It consists of a high-resolution segmented BGO electromagnetic calorimeter with a depth of 32 radiation lengths, a silicon-tungsten tracker-converter with an angular resolution below 0.2°, an anti-coincidence shield and ion detector, and a neutron detector. The detector characteristics and performance, and the latest observations of cosmic electrons up to 5 TeV, protons and nuclei up to 100 TeV and gamma-rays up to 10 TeV will be presented.	2019-08-22 08:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity		Piergiorgio Fusco	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3535392/attachments/1895823/3127713/ICNFP_2019_Fusco.pdf
100	Recent results on flow in small systems	The last decades of high energy physics revealed, that in ultra-relativistic    ion-ion collisions, a strongly interacting quark gluon plasma (sQGP) is created.    Varying the collision energy and system size allows for the investigation of the    phase diagram of QCD matter at different baryochemical potentials and    temperatures. Varying the system size may also reveal the influence of system    lifetime on the final state observables. In the recent years, it became a more    and more important question how the matter created in small but energetic    collision systems behaves, and the extent of similarity between small and large    systems is investigated at several experiments. One of the most important    results of the recent years was the elliptic and triangular flow in p+Au, d+Au    and He3+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV at PHENIX. In this talk we will    review these results, along with a few other important flow measurements from RHIC and LHC.	2019-08-21 13:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Lectures	Lectures	Mate Csanad	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3534195/attachments/1895571/3127218/csanad_heavyions_icnfp2019.pdf, https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3534195/attachments/1895571/3127217/csanad_heavyions_icnfp2019.pptx
103	Search for sub-GeV/c² dark matter with CRESST-III	Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most puzzling mysteries of modern physics. Albeit various astronomical observations confirm its existence, no unambiguous theory of DM exists. CRESST-III is one of the leading experiments searching for a hypothetical DM particle candidate.    The CRESST-III experiment searches for direct interactions of dark matter with ordinary matter at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy. The main event signature would be a nuclear recoil inside one of the scintillating target crystals. Operating the crystals as cryogenic calorimeters at $\mathcal{O}(10\,\mathrm{mK})$ provides in addition a phonon signal as a measure of the deposited energy. The simultaneous readout of both a scintillation light and a phonon signal is used to actively discriminate backgrounds.    CRESST-III focuses on the sub-GeV/c² mass region where the sensitivity is driven by the threshold. With a $\mathrm{CaWO_4}$ crystal of 24g as target an unprecedented low threshold of 30.1eV for nuclear recoils was obtained in the first data taking campaign of CRESST-III from 2016-2018.    In this contribution, we briefly motivate the existence of DM and review the current landscape. Afterwards we will introduce CRESST, focusing on the requirements to maintain sensitivity in the sub-GeV/c² mass region. We will discuss the latest results of CRESST-III on spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions. Finally, we will give an outlook to future stages of CRESST.	2019-08-28 08:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity		Holger Kluck	
107	Azimuthal anisotropy Fourier harmonic correlations and initial-state fluctuations from HYDJET++ and AMPT modela	Azimuthal anisotropy correlations between different Fourier harmonics, $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$  measured with two-particle correlations in simulated PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}=2.76~$TeV, generated with HYDJET++ and AMPT generator, are presented. The results are compared with data from the ATLAS experiment. Both models are in good agreement with data for $v_2$-$v_3$ correlation. For $v_2$-$v_4$ and $v_3$-$v_4$ correlations AMPT model is still in good agreement with experimental observations, while HYDJET++ gives stronger slopes with respect to the ones observed by the ATLAS collaboration. Further, initial-state fluctuations from HYDJET++ model are measured in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}=5.02~$TeV by comparing $v_2$ results obtained with different Q-cumulant order, $v_2\{2\},v_2\{4\},v_2\{6\},$ and $v_2\{8\}$. The model calculation shows good qualitative and rather good quantitative agreement with results reported by the CMS experiment.	2019-08-26 09:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Milan Stojanovic	
117	An overview of the ATLAS NSW Micromegas construction project at Aristotle University	The upcoming luminosity upgrade of the LHC will impose new requirements for the detector  installations. To perform under these conditions the Micromegas (MM) technology was selected to be adopted in the New Small Wheel (NSW) upgrade, dedicated to precision tracking. A large surface of the forward regions of the Muon Spectrometer will be equipped with 8 layers of MM modules forming a total active area of 1200 m2. The NSW is planned to be installed in the forward region of 1.3 < |η| < 2.7 of ATLAS. The NSW will have to operate in a high background radiation region, while reconstructing muon tracks as well as furnishing information for the Level-1 trigger. The project requires fully efficient MM chambers with spatial resolution down to 100 μm, a rate capability up to about 15 kHz/cm2 and operation in a moderate (highly inhomogeneous) magnetic field up to B=0.3 T. The required tracking is linked to the intrinsic spatial resolution in combination with the demanding mechanical accuracy.    An overview of the design, construction and QA/QC procedures followed at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki for the Micromegas LM2 Drift panels production will be presented.	2019-08-26 12:25:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Mini Workshop on Instruments and Methods in HEP		Christos Lampoudis	
120	Neutron production and exotic physics with SNO	The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO), built to study neutrinos produced in the Sun, discovered that neutrinos can change flavour and, thus, they are massive particles. SNO detected and recorded neutrino and cosmic ray interactions from 1999 to 2006 and several analyses have been completed in the past year using legacy data. We present the results of the most recent ones, namely: measurement of neutron production in atmospheric neutrino interactions, a search for Lorentz violation, and a search for potential neutrino decay. The former is important to better understand neutrino interactions and reduce backgrounds in supernova neutrino and nucleon decay searches, and the last two analyses yield new constraints on exotic physics searches. Finally, we will touch on the status of other on-going analyses.	2019-08-26 13:30:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Javier Caravaca Rodriguez	
121	SNO+: recent results and prospects	SNO+ is a multi-purpose experiment whose main purpose is to study the nature of the neutrino mass through observation of neutrino-less double beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$). Detection of this rare process would indicate that neutrinos are elementary Majorana particles, proving that lepton number is not conserved and providing an estimate of their unknown absolute mass. The SNO+ detector will operate in three distinct phases with different target materials: water, pure scintillator (LABPPO) and tellurium-loaded scintillator. We will report results on the measurement of the radioactive backgrounds, as well as, the results of the solar neutrino and invisible nucleon decay analyses, performed during the water phase, now concluded. Furthermore, the status, potential and prospect of SNO+ for precise solar neutrino measurements and 0$\nu\beta\beta$ search will be presented.	2019-08-27 13:30:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Javier Caravaca Rodriguez	
123	Searching for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay with the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR	The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR is a neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment currently operating two modules of p-type point contact germanium detectors at the 4850' level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility. Our latest results from 26 kg-yr of exposure set a half-life lower limit of 2.7 x $10^{25}$ yr (90% C.L) owing to an unprecedented energy resolution of 2.5 keV FWHM and a background rate of 12 cts/(FWHM t yr) at the $^{76}$Ge double-beta decay Q value of 2039 keV. Due to its low background rate, the DEMONSTRATOR’s physics data set has also been used to search for other physics beyond the Standard Model, including bosonic dark matter and tri-nucleon decay. Optimization of background-reducing analysis techniques and the development of a complete background model are expected to yield improved background rejection and to inform the design and background expectations of the next-generation LEGEND experiment. In this talk, I will review the key physics and technical results from the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR and report on progress in background reduction and modeling.	2019-08-28 09:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity		Anna Reine	
131	In-medium spectral functions of vector and axial-vector mesons from analytically continued FRG flow equations	The Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) can be used to calculate spectral functions from analytically continued FRG flow equations for two-point correlation functions. Here we report on the current status of applying this aFRG framework to the calculation of vector and axial-vector meson spectral functions in effective hadronic theories at finite temperature and density. Their medium modifications have a direct impact on the electromagnetic spectral function and thus on thermal dilepton rates in the range of invariant-mass values of up to about 1 GeV. Because chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and/or density is reflected in these spectral functions, this can be exploited to search for experimental signatures, from heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies and later with CBM at FAIR, of a chiral first-order phase transition and the associated critical endpoint (CEP) in the phase diagram of QCD.	2019-08-22 14:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on QCD		Lorenz von Smekal	
132	UPGRADE OF THE ALICE INNER TRACKING SYSTEM: CONSTRUCTION AND COMMISSIONING	ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is the CERN LHC experiment optimized for the study of the strongly interacting matter produced in heavy-ion collisions, in particular the characterization of the quark-gluon plasma. After the successful operation of the experiment during the first two runs of the LHC, the ALICE collaboration is currently working on a major upgrade of its detector, to be installed during the Long Shutdown (LS2) in 2019-2020. The main goal is to increase the readout capabilities to allow for the readout and recording of Pb–Pb minimum bias events at rates in excess of 50 kHz, the expected Pb–Pb interaction rate at the LHC after LS2. One key part of the upgrade is the construction of a new Inner Tracking System (ITS) that will significantly improve the impact parameter resolution, tracking efficiency and readout capacity enabling precise measurement of low momentum particles. The new ITS consists of seven approximately-cylindrical detector layers based on CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) with the sensor matrix and readout integrated in a single chip, named ALPIDE (ALice PIxel DEtector), with a pixel size of 29x27m2, covering an area of 10m2 and containing about 12.5 billion pixels. All layers are mounted on ultra-lightweight carbon support structures with an embedded cooling system. This allows a reduction of the material budget down to the 0.3 % X0 for the inner layers and 1% X0 for the outer layers.    This talk will give a brief overview of the motivation of the upgrade, give details on the overall layout and reports on both the construction and commissioning status and plans. Ideas on a further novel vertex detector based on curved wafer-scale ultra-thin silicon sensors will be illustrated.     Possible applications of the technologies, developed by the ALICE collaboration, will be also shown.	2019-08-26 14:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Alessandra  Fantoni	
133	Quark-diquark models and fluctuations in thermal QCD	Fluctuations of conserved charges such as baryon number, electric charge and strangeness [1,2] may provide a test for completeness of states in lattice QCD for three light flavors [3-7]. We elaborate on the idea that the corresponding susceptibilities can be saturated with excited baryonic states with an underlying quark-diquark structure with a linearly confining interaction. Using Polyakov-loop correlators we show that in the static limit, the quark-diquark potential coincides with the quark-antiquark potential in marked agreement with recent lattice studies. We thus study in a quark-diquark model the baryonic fluctuations of electric charge, baryon number and strangeness: $\chi_{BQ}$, $\chi_{BB}$ and $\chi_{BS}$; by considering a realization of the hadron resonance gas model in the light flavor sector of QCD [8]. These results have been obtained by using the baryon spectrum computed within a relativistic quark-diquark model, leading to an overall good agreement with the spectrum obtained with other quark models and with lattice data for the fluctuations.

135	Highlights from CMS	Very successful operation of the CMS detector for almost 10 years allowed the CMS collaboration to produce a large number of results,    from the discovery of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its properties, to setting stringent limits on the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model.    This talk will briefly summarize some of the experimental challenges and give an overview of some of the main physics results delivered so far.    This includes results on the Higgs boson coupling to fermions, the search for Supersymmetry in several final state topologies, and other selected searches for particles beyond the Standard Model.    A brief overview of the preparations for an upgrade to the experiment for operation at the High Luminosity LHC starting in the mid-2020s also will be reported.	2019-08-23 05:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	LHC Plenary Session		Mia Tosi	
142	Methods of Hyperspherical Functions with Application of Neutron Rich Isotopes in Heavy Ion Reactions	The effect of projectile shape on cross sections and momentum distributions of fragments from heavy ion reactions is studied. We propose a new approach that implements the underlying symmetries of each isotope with a few parameters directly in the density. Various densities and their nuclear structure are then analyzed in the reactions of 12C and 11Li, 11Be, and 11 C on a carbon target.	2019-08-26 10:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Klara LaGrance, Hasanuzzaman Rahman	
143	Optimising the performance of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter to measure Higgs properties during Phase I and Phase II of the LHC	The CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL), is a high granularity lead tungstate crystal calorimeter operating at the CERN LHC. The original design placed a premium on excellent energy resolution. Excellent energy resolution and efficient identification for photons are essential to reconstruct the Higgs boson in the H->gg decay channel, for measurements of the self-coupling of Higgs bosons and other related parameters.    The ECAL performance has been crucial in the discovery and subsequent characterisation of the Higgs boson. The original ECAL design considerations, and the actual experimental energy reconstruction and calibration precision will be reviewed.    The improvements to the energy reconstruction and energy calibration algorithms for LHC Run II are described. These are required to maintain the stability of the ECAL energy scale and resolution for the higher LHC luminosities that have been experienced compared to Run I. The precision measurement of the Higgs decay modes is central to the HL-LHC physics program. In addition, the search for di-Higgs production is important to understand the details of the vacuum potential. The crystals in the barrel region will be retained for HL-LHC. The decrease of operating temperature and upgrades to the readout electronics that are needed to maintain the required performance of the barrel region from 2026 onwards will be described.    These upgrades will ensure that radiation-induced noise increases will not dominate the energy resolution for photons from Higgs boson decays, and will preserve the ability of CMS to trigger efficiently on these signals. They will also permit precision time measurements (30 ps rms error on the arrival time of photons from Higgs boson decays) which will improve the determination of the location of the production vertex for di-photon events. Time measurement performance of the new readout electronics has been characterized in beam tests.    The predicted electron and photon energy resolution and identification efficiencies expected for HL-LHC will be described, and the performance relevant to a number of key Higgs decay channels will be presented.	2019-08-24 09:40:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Amina Zghiche	
145	A high precision narrow-band neutrino beam: the ENUBET project	The knowledge of initial flux, energy and flavor of current neutrino beams is currently the main limitation for a precise measurement of neutrino cross sections. The ENUBET ERC project (2016-2021) is studying a facility based on a narrow band neutrino beam capable of constraining the neutrino fluxes normalization through the monitoring of the associated charged leptons in an instrumented decay tunnel. Since March 2019, ENUBET is also a CERN Neutrino Platform project (NP06/ENUBET) developed in collaboration with CERN A&T and CERN-EN. In ENUBET, the identification of large-angle positrons from $K_{e3}$ decays at single particle level can potentially reduce the $\nu_e$ flux uncertainty at the level of 1%. This setup would allow for an unprecedented measurement of the $\nu_e$ cross section at the GeV scale. Such an experimental input would be highly beneficial to reduce the budget of systematic uncertainties in the next long baseline oscillation projects (i.e HyperK-DUNE). Furthermore, in narrow-band beams, the transverse position of the neutrino interaction at the detector can be exploited to determine a priori with significant precision the neutrino energy spectrum without relying on the final state reconstruction.     This contribution will present the final design of the ENUBET demonstrator, which has been selected on April 2019 on the basis of the results of the 2016-2018 testbeams. It will also discuss advances in the design and simulation of the hadronic beam line. Special emphasis will be given to a static focusing system of secondary mesons that, unlike the other studied horn-based solution, can be coupled to a slow extraction proton scheme. The consequent reduction of particle rates and pile-up effects makes the determination of the $\nu_{\mu}$ flux through a direct monitoring of muons after the hadron dump viable, and paves the way to a time-tagged neutrino beam. Time-coincidences among the lepton at the source and the neutrino at the detector would enable an unprecedented purity and the possibility to reconstruct the neutrino kinematics at source on an event by event basis. We will also present the performance of positron tagger prototypes tested at CERN beamlines, a full simulation of the positron reconstruction chain and the expected physics reach of ENUBET.

149	European Strategy Update: ATLAS physics prospects at the HL-LHC	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been successfully delivering proton-proton collision data at the unprecedented center of mass energy of 13 TeV.    An upgrade is planned to increase the instantaneous luminosity delivered    by LHC in what is called HL-LHC, aiming to deliver a total of about 3000/fb of data to the ATLAS detector. To cope with the expected data-taking conditions ATLAS is planning major upgrades of the detector.     In this contribution we present an overview of the physics reach expected for a wide range of measurements and searches at the HL-LHC for the ATLAS experiment, including Higgs coupling, di-Higgs boson production sensitivity, Vector Boson Scattering prospects as well as discovery potential for electroweak SUSY and other exotic benchmark scenarios.    Such studies formed the basis of the ATLAS Collaboration input to the recent HL/HE-LHC Yellow-Report. An executive summary of this report was then submitted as input to the European Strategy process.	2019-08-26 14:45:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session on High Energy Particle Physics		Francesca Pastore	
152	Flavor Decompositions of Nucleon, Δ, and Hyperon Electromagnetic Form Factors	There is considerable phenomenological insight into the flavor compositions of nucleon electromagnetic form factors from elastic electron scattering on both the proton and the neutron at low and moderate momentum transfers. The flavor contents extracted so far from the corresponding world data sets impose severe tests on any theoretical description of the electromagnetic structure of the nucleons.    I shall discuss the predictions for covariant electric and magnetic form factors by a relativistic constituent-quark model and compare them to phenomenology as well as some results from lattice quantum chromodynamics. The main findings are that valence-quark contributions play the essential roles up to momentum transfers of q^2 ~ 4 GeV^2 and additional degrees of freedom, e.g., sea-quark effects, are still absent or at least negligible in this domain.    The same kind of studies is extended to the Δ and the hyperons showing interesting effects depending on the flavor structures of the particles belonging to either singlet, octet, and decuplet flavor multiplets as well as their admixtures.	2019-08-22 09:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Lepton Nucleon Scattering Mini-workshop	Special session on Lepton-Nucleus scattering and Structure of the Nucleon	Willibald Plessas	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3535340/attachments/1895887/3127848/Plessas_ICNFP2019-Lepton_rev.pdf
155	Probing perturbative QCD using electroweak bosons at the ATLAS detector	The production of prompt isolated photons, W-bosons and Z-bosons in proton-proton collisions provides a stringent test of perturbative QCD and yields important information about the parton distribution functions (PDFs) for quarks within the proton. In this talk, we present precision measurements of these final states across four different proton-proton centre-of-mass energies using data collected by the ATLAS experiment. The measurements are compared with (next-to-)next-to-leading-order QCD cross-section calculations and different parton distribution functions. Measurements of the isolated-photon plus two jets and the inclusive isolated-photons cross sections at sqrt(s)=13 TeV are presented, along with the ratio of photon cross sections at sqrt(s)=8 and sqrt(s)=13 TeV. The results are compared with state-of-the-art theory predictions, indicating several interesting discrepancies. We report measurements of fiducial integrated and differential cross sections for inclusive W+, W- and Z boson production at sqrt(s)=2.76 and sqrt(s)=5.02 TeV. Measurements of the W+ and W- cross sections at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, in bins of the absolute lepton rapidity, and the associated charge asymmetry are also presented. Finally, a measurement of Z+jet production at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV is also presented.	2019-08-23 09:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on QCD		Vasiliki Kouskoura	
159	The status of the SoLid experiment	SoLid is a very short baseline reactor neutrino oscillation experiment. The goal of the experiment is to test the sterile neutrino hypothesis and to measure the BR2 reactor antineutrino spectrum of pure $^{235}$U with high precision. Operation of detector on the surface and very close to the research reactor core requires handling  the high levels of background induced by the reactor and cosmic rays. SoLid has a unique take on those measurements; it uses an innovative highly segmented solid scintillation technology, combining PVT (cubes of 5×5×5 cm$^3$ ) and $^6$LiF:ZnS (sheets $\sim 250 \mu$m thickness) scintillators. This combination provides a linear energy response with good resolution and unprecedented spatial and time reconstruction of antineutrino interactions. The detector system is highly segmented, read out by a network of wavelength shifting fibers and SiPMs with an intelligent triggering scheme that records real time data with high efficiency. The detector has been taking physics data for almost a year in the BR2 reactor area. We will present an overview of the experiment, the detailed features of antineutrino reconstruction in SoLid, the calibration methods, background rejection capabilities and some preliminary analysis of the antineutrino data.	2019-08-28 12:20:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Simon Vercaemer	
160	Measurements of multiboson production using the ATLAS detector	The production of multiple electroweak bosons at the LHC constitutes a stringent test of the electroweak sector and provide a model-independent means to search for new physics at the TeV scale. In this talk, we present recent results for inclusive WW, WZ, ZZ and Z$\gamma$ production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt s$ = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment. The data are sensitive to anomalous triple gauge couplings and are reinterpreted in terms of an effective field theory to constrain new physics beyond the Standard Model. In addition, the unfolded differential cross section for four-lepton production is presented and compared to state-of-the-art Standard Model calculations. Finally, evidence for the production of three massive vector bosons in WWW, WWZ and WZZ final states is presented.	2019-08-28 10:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	LHC Semiplenary Session		Jessica Metcalfe	
163	Testing Dark Matter models and Quantum Foundations with the SABRE experiment	The Sodium-iodide with Active Background REjection (SABRE) experiment is designed to search for the annual modulation of the dark matter interaction rate with NaI(Tl) crystals. The experiment will also be able to perform a conclusive and model-independent test of the DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation signal. This signal is compatible with the expected dark matter galactic distribution, but it is in contrast with observations from different-target dark matter experiments under the standard WIMP hypothesis.     SABRE will perform a high sensitivity dark matter search using NaI(Tl) crystals with unprecedented radio-purity operated inside a liquid scintillator veto for active background rejection. The properties of such crystals make the experiment also ideal for the detection of faint x-ray emissions from charged particles, which are a by-product of certain quantum mechanics theories. The most popular of such theories are the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) and the Diosi-Penrose (DP) models, which address foundational quantum mechanics problems like: “why the wave function of a quantum system collapses to a single state as a consequence of the measurement of one of its observables?” and “how classical macroscopic behaviours emerge from the quantum world?”.     The first phase of the experiment, the SABRE Proof-of-Principle (PoP), is underway. A single 3.5 kg crystal detector is hosted in a two-ton liquid scintillator veto system at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. The goal of this phase is to measure the crystal background, test the active background rejection system.    This talk will illustrate the characteristics of the SABRE experiment and its expected sensitivity at testing both dark matter theories and quantum mechanics models. The status of the SABRE PoP and any preliminary result will also be presented.	2019-08-26 12:40:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Francesco Nuti	
165	Single- and Multi-harmonic Flow Fluctuations in Heavy-Ion Collisions	According to the widely accepted picture in the heavy-ion community, the observed non-uniform distribution of particles in the final momentum space is a manifestation of the non-uniformities in the initial energy density and the collective evolution of interacting matter. Furthermore, the initial energy density profile fluctuates from one event to the other, and this event-by-event fluctuation leads to a rich statistical structure of flow harmonic fluctuations in the final stage. Up to the present day, only a tiny corner of this statistical structure has been explored. The cumulants of individual flow harmonics have been studied extensively, and only recently the correlations of two different flow harmonics, via the new flow observables called Symmetric Cumulants (SC), have been investigated. Moreover, the fluctuations are mostly considered to be Gaussian while recent studies indicate that the skewness and kurtosis of the fluctuations are nonvanishing and their connection to the  cumulants of individual flow harmonics is stablished.    In this talk, we first show how we can go one step further in understanding the flow fluctuations by introducing generalized SCs, the genuine correlation between more than two different flow harmonics. Generalized SCs provide new and independent information for Quark-Gluon Plasma properties, which is inaccessible to other flow observables used by now. Then by employing the iEBE-VISHNU model, we demonstrate the first predictions for the generalized SCs at LHC energies. We also show that they are robust against systematics biases from nonflow effects by exploiting the HIJING event generator. Additionally, we will show how one can connect the non-Gaussianity to the cumulants of the individual flow harmonics  systematically. We stress that in interpreting the cumulants as genuine anisotropic flow the fluctuations have to be considered as a Gaussian distribution. For the case the fluctuations are manifestly non-Gaussian, we present a new estimator for the genuine anisotropic flow in terms of cumulants.    Based on:     [1] C. Mordasini, A. Bilandzic, D.

166	ATLAS results on quarkonia and heavy flavour production	The associated production of vector boson with quarkonia is a key observable for understanding the quarkonium production mechanisms, including the separation of single and double parton scattering components. This talk will present the latest measurements from ATLAS on quarkonium production, including associated production, and recent results from heavy flavour production.	2019-08-28 14:10:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Tatiana Lyubushkina	
171	Flavour Anomalies in Rare Decays and prospects of flavour physics at LHCb	Rare decays are powerful probes for Physics beyond the Standard Model    (SM), as new particles can have a large impact on physics observables.    Recent results on lepton universality tests and measurements of    branching fractions and angular distributions of rare b->sll decays have    shown tensions with the SM predictions. The LHCb experiment is ideally    suited for the study of the these flavour anomalies, due to its large    acceptance, precise vertexing and powerful particle identification    capabilities. This talk will review the latest results from LHCb on the flavour anomalies and their interpretation and will give a prospect of future measurements by LHCb.	2019-08-26 14:20:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session on B physics at LHC		Jacopo Pinzino	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3536387/attachments/1896059/3128156/Pinzino_icnfp_new.pdf
172	Jet quenching in expanding medium	Comprehensive understanding of medium-induced radiative energy loss is of a paramount importance in describing observed jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we calculate the medium-modified gluon splitting rates for different profiles of the expanding partonic medium, namely profiles for static, exponential, and Bjorken  expanding medium. In the presented study, the Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff-Zakharov (BDMPSZ) formalism is used for multiple soft scatterings with a time-dependent transport coefficient for characterizing the expanding medium. The medium-evolved gluon spectra are systematically calculated using the kinetic rate equation for all the medium profiles and a study of the distinctive features at low and high momentum fractions of radiated gluons are provided. Finally, we provide a calculation of the jet $R_{AA}$ which quantifies a sensitivity of the inclusive jet suppression on the way how the medium expands. Comparisons of predicted jet $R_{AA}$ with experimental data from the LHC are also provided.	2019-08-24 08:00:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Souvik Priyam Adhya	
176	Searches for new phenomena with the ATLAS detector	Many theories beyond the Standard Model (BSM) predict new phenomena accessible by the LHC. Searches for new physics models are performed using the ATLAS experiment at the LHC focusing on exotic signatures that can be realized in several BSM theories, excluding supersymmetry. The results of recent searches on 13 TeV data, with the exception of Dark Matter signatures, and their interplay and interpretation will be presented. Prospects for HL-LHC will also be discussed.	2019-08-28 08:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	LHC Semiplenary Session		Francesco Guescini	
179	New results from the DANSS experiment	Recently the MiniBooNE collaboration observed electron (anti)neutrino appearance in the muon (anti)neutrino beams. The significance of the effect reaches 6.0σ level when combined with the LSND result. Even more recently the NEUTRINO-4 collaboration claimed the observation of electron antineutrino oscillations to sterile neutrinos with a significance of about 3σ. If these results are confirmed, New Physics beyond the Standard Model would be required.     On the other hand, the DANSS experiment and several other reactor experiments at short baselines obtained quite strict limits on the hypothetical sterile neutrino parameters. We present new results of the DANSS experiment on the searches for sterile neutrinos. They are based on more than 2 million of inverse beta decay events collected at 10.7, 11.7 and 12.7 meters from the reactor core of the 3.1 GW Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant in Russia. This data sample is 2.4 times larger than the data sample in the previous DANSS publication.  The neutrino spectrum dependence on the fuel composition is also presented. We have also measured the reactor power using the IBD event rate during 17 months with the statistical accuracy 1.5% in 2 days and with the relative systematic uncertainty of about 0.5%.	2019-08-28 12:40:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Nataliya Skrobova	
182	ATLAS results on Higgs boson properties	After the discovery of the Higgs boson in summer 2012, the understanding of its properties has been a high priority of the ATLAS physics program.

185	Production of light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei at LHC energies with ALICE	The ALICE experiment has measured a variety of (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei produced in Pb-Pb collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV  and at  2.76 TeV. In addition, a large sample of high-quality data  was recorded in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ =5.02, 7 and 13 TeV and in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. These data are used to study the production of (anti-)deuteron, (anti-)$^{3}\rm{He}$, (anti-)$^{4}\rm{He}$  and (anti-)hypertriton.    The identification of these (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei is based on the energy loss measurements in the Time Projection Chamber and the velocity measurements in the Time-Of-Flight detector. In addition, the Inner Tracking System is used to distinguish secondary vertices originating from weak decays away from the primary vertex.    An interesting collection of results on deuteron production as a function of multiplicity in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions will be presented, as well as the measurement of $^{3}\rm{He}$ in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions. Special emphasis will be put on new results on the production and lifetime of the hypertriton.    The large variety of measurements at different energies and system sizes allows us to constrain the models of the production mechanism of light flavour baryon clusters, in particular those based on coalescence and the statistical hadronisation approaches.	2019-08-27 09:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Stefania Bufalino

In this work we present the latest results of the data analysis concerning the estimation of the shower parameters using the RF system. In a recent layout of the array, 4 RF antennas were operating receiving a common trigger of a single autonomous station of 3 particle detecors. These data are compared with the simulation predictions investigating if a single antenna is capable for the estimation of the shower axis angular direction as well as the capability of this geometry to reconstruct the shower core, the energy and the mass of the primary particle.	2019-08-26 14:40:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Mini Workshop on Instruments and Methods in HEP		Stavros Nonis	
196	Heavy-flavour jets in ALICE	Heavy-flavour quarks are considered to be effective probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Since heavy-flavour quarks have a large mass, their production takes place mostly in initial hard scatterings, and it is calculable using perturbative QCD. Thus, heavy flavour quarks can be considered as ideal self-generated penetrating probes of the created medium and utilized to investigate mass-dependent properties of in-medium parton energy loss or cold nuclear matter.     In particular the measurement of heavy-flavour jet production in pp, besides beeing a natural reference for Pb-Pb studies, allow testing pQCD calculations and models of charm fragmentation in vacuum. In addition, similar measurements in p-Pb collisions allow assessing the importance of cold nuclear matter effects. The ALICE experiment at the LHC exploits its excellent particle tracking capabilities, that allow for a precise jet reconstruction and for the identification of D and B-hadron decay vertices, displaced hundreds of micrometers from the primary interaction vertex.  In the talk we will report on our heavy-flavour jet measurements done in p-Pb and pp collisions.	2019-08-22 14:00:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Mini Workshop on Instruments and Methods in HEP		Artem Isakov	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3535439/attachments/1895893/3127821/ICNFP_2019_HF_in_ALICE_v9.pdf
197	Evaluation of target non-uniformity and dispersion effects on energy measurement resolution in NUMEN experiment	In the NUMEN Experiment, a number of double Exchange reactions will be studied in order to get very precise measurements of their cross sections and final state levels. The interest for these reactions lies in the possibility for some nuclides, to have DCE with initial and final states identical to those of the Neutrino-less Double Beta Decay [1]. To reach a good precision in the energy measurements, high statistics is needed and severe constraints about the target thickness must be satisfied. The main sources of error are the straggling of projectiles and products and the dispersion effect inside the target. Both are related to the target thickness, which must be of the order of few hundreds nanometre. Moreover, the thickness uniformity plays a crucial role in the spread of the energy. The solution to these problems has been found by designing a target as a target isotope deposition on a substrate of special graphite (HOPG) [2], whose thermodynamic properties fit the cooling requirements [3]. The results of the chosen deposition technique (Electron Beam) for 116Sn, 130Te, 76Ge isotopes will be illustrated in terms of electron microscopy (FESEM) images. A more precise quantitative evaluation of the thickness distribution has been performed by Rutherford Back Scattering (RBS) and alpha-transmission measurements. The latter one allows to estimate also the thickness uniformity. In addition, a Montecarlo code has been implemented, aiming to estimate the precision of the measurements of the final states nuclear levels. The Montecarlo results will be reported in the talk for all the targets, together with the results of the tests of thickness and thickness uniformity, obtained with the above mentioned techniques.

198	Searches for squarks and gluinos with the ATLAS detector	Despite the absence of experimental evidence, weak scale supersymmetry remains one of the best motivated and studied Standard Model extensions. This talk summarizes recent ATLAS results on searches for supersymmetric squarks and gluinos, including third generation squarks produced directly or via decay of gluinos. Some models of supersymmetry, including models with R-parity violation, predict that the lightest supersymmetric particle will decay back into Standard Model particles, removing the classical missing transverse momentum signature. These more difficult signatures have also been investigated, and results from these searches are presented.	2019-08-22 13:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Kazuki Todome	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3535432/attachments/1896072/3128177/ICNFP_squark_gluinos_v5.pdf
199	Multiplicity and energy dependence of light charged particle production in ALICE at the LHC	ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is the CERN LHC experiment optimized for the study of the strongly interacting matter produced in heavy-ion collisions and for the characterization of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).    ALICE has collected precision data at different energies for pp, p-Pb, Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions: this unique set of data allows us to investigate bulk particle production for very different systems and compare them at similar multiplicities. In particular, light flavour particles, containing only u, d and s valence quarks, are the most copiusly produced and so they play a central role in the characterization of the bulk properties of the QGP, carrying essential information about the produced medium and reaction dynamics.    Part of this information is carried by the inclusive and identified transverse momentum distributions of light charged particles, measured over a wide $p_\mathrm{T}$ range thanks to the excellent tracking and particle-identification capabilities of the ALICE detector.    Such distributions show that at low to intermediate $p_\mathrm{T}$ charged particle production is governed by the collective expansion of the system. The chemical and kinetic freeze-out parameters of the system are extracted via statistical-thermal and combined blast-wave fits to the data in heavy-ion collisions and are compared to results obtained in pp and p-Pb collisions at similar multiplicities. At high $p_\mathrm{T}$, typically above 5 GeV/$c$, a suppression of hadronic production, due to medium effects such as parton energy loss, can be observed. These effects can be investigated by calculating the nuclear modification factor, defined as the ratio between the $p_\mathrm{T}$ spectrum measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions and a reference spectrum in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions.    In this talk, we review the most recent ALICE results on the production of pions, kaons and protons, including transverse momentum spectra, yields, particle ratios, mean transverse momenta and nuclear modification factors, for various centrality/multiplicity classes.	2019-08-26 12:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Marco Toppi	
204	The ALICE Upgrade: Future Prospects	The Large Hadron Collider at CERN along with all its experiments are in a shutdown period preparing for a large luminosity upgrade. This upgrade presents both challenges and opportunities to the experiments. For ALICE, this large increase in luminosity necessitates an upgrade in the electronics for many subsystems to cope with a much larger event rate. Additionally, the subsystems themselves are being upgraded or replaced to be able to run in these conditions and provide new capabilities. The inner tracking system of ALICE is being replaced to provide higher vertex and track pointing resolution and the time projection chamber is being upgraded to allow for continuous readout employing GEM detectors. These new capabilities along with the associated increase will open new avenues of study for ALICE concerning heavy-flavor, quarkonia, low mass dileptons, and jets. This talk will outline the current upgrade projects along with which new physics results can be expected from ALICE with the new high luminosity beams.	2019-08-26 14:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Kristjan Gulbrandsen

207	ALICE Overview	In recent years, the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC has published a lot of exciting    measurements aiming to characterise the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP),    a state of matter formed in high energy collisions at extremely high temperature    and/or energy density.     ALICE has collected precision data at different energies for proton-proton (pp),    proton-lead (p-Pb), lead-lead (Pb-Pb) and xenon-xenon (Xe-Xe) collisions.     In this presentation, we will summarise the results that best represent a step forward    towards the understanding of the QGP formed at the LHC.      Emphasis will be given to recent results from the LHC run 2, spanning from the soft    sector (bulk particle production and correlations) to hard probes (charmed hadrons    and jets), and to signatures of possible collective effects in high multiplicity pp    and p-Pb collisions.	2019-08-26 06:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	LHC Plenary Session		Massimo Masera	
208	K$^-$-nucleon/nuclei interaction studies at low-energy by AMADEUS and SIDDHARTA-2	The AMADEUS and SIDDHARTA-2 collaborations aim to provide experimental information on the low-energy strong interaction between antikaons and nucleons. The investigation of the antikaons dynamics in nuclear medium is fundamental for understanding the non-perturbative QCD in the strangeness sector, with implications going from the domain of nuclear physics to astrophysics. The DA$\Phi$NE collider provides a unique source of monochromatic low-momentum kaons (p$_K$ ~ 127 MeV/c) from the $\phi$-meson decay nearly at-rest, ideal to explore the interactions of the kaons at low-energy or to stop them in the targets. SIDDHARTA-2, which is the upgraded experiment of SIDDHARTA, studies the physics of kaonic atoms. The goal is to measure the X-rays emitted in the atomic transitions of the kaonic deuterium, the energy shift and the width of the 1s level will allow to extract for the first time the isospin dependence of the KbarN scattering amplitude at the threshold. AMADEUS explores the absorptions of the K$^-$ in light nuclei (H, $^4$He, $^9$Be and $^{12}$C) in order to extract information about the possible existence of kaonic bound states with nucleons and the properties of hyperon resonances in the nuclear environment. As a first step, the hadronic interactions of the negatively charged kaons with the materials of the KLOE detector, used as an active target, are investigated through hyperon-nucleon/nuclei (YN) and hyperon-pion (Y$\pi$) correlation studies.	2019-08-27 14:10:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Raffaele Del Grande	
209	CALET on the International Space Station: the first three years of observations	The CALorimetric Electron Telescope CALET is a space instrument designed to carry out precision measurements of high energy cosmic-rays on the JEM-EF external platform of the ISS where it has been collecting science data continuously since mid October 2015.     In addition to its primary goal of identifying nearby sources of high-energy electrons and possible signatures of dark matter in the electron spectrum, CALET is carrying out extensive measurements of the energy spectra, relative abundances and secondary-to-primary ratios of elements from proton to iron and above (up to Z=40) studying the details of galactic particle propagation and acceleration.     An overview of CALET based on the data taken during the first three years of observations is presented including a direct measurement of the electron+positron energy spectrum from 11 GeV to 4.8 TeV. The proton spectrum has been measured from 50 GeV to 10 TeV covering, for the first time with a single space-borne instrument, the whole energy interval previously investigated in separate sub-ranges by magnetic spectrometers and calorimetric instruments. Preliminary spectra of cosmic-ray nuclei are also presented, together with gamma-ray observations and searches of an e.m. counterpart of LIGO/Virgo GW events.	2019-08-26 13:30:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Paolo Brogi	
212	From alpha clustering to homogeneous matter	Over the last few decades the study of nuclei and neutron-rich matter from first principles has entered a new era. This has partly been driven by the development of novel interactions between two or three nucleons. In an attempt to produce a systematic expansion, several groups have produced Effective Field Theory (EFT) interactions, whether of finite range (chiral EFT) or zero range (pionless EFT). Pionless EFT has been quite successful in studies of cold-atomic Fermi gases. In this talk, I will present recent Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of 8-particle systems and discuss their impact on 8Be and the physics of alpha clustering. I will also discuss recent work on trying to connect ab initio theory with simpler qualitative pictures. Specifically, I will address the first ever systematic non-perturbative calculations of the single-particle excitation spectrum in strongly interacting neutron matter. In addition to impacting light and neutron-rich nuclei, this work and this talk also touch upon the physics of ultracold gases and of neutron stars.		30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity		Alexandros Gezerlis	
213	Diffuse neutrinos: a look into the past	We are entering an era of unprecedented capabilities for astronomical observations. The analysis of signals in multiple bands, i.e., gravitational waves, gamma and X-rays emissions, will provide detailed insight about the physics of diverse astrophysical phenomena such as neutron star mergers. Neutrinos emitted from compact objects and their mergers, besides playing an important role in the synthesis of elements, can potentially be observed on Earth. Such signals will contribute to our overall understanding of the evolution of these objects. While the occurrence of e.g mergers in the Galaxy is rare, neutrinos from mergers and supernovae have been emitted since these events started occurring in the Universe, and due to their weakly interacting character they are permeating space. Can we detect these neutrinos? In this talk, I shall introduce the diffuse neutrino background from accretion disks, formed during collapsars and neutron star mergers, and discuss its possible detection on Earth.		30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity		Caballero Liliana

216	ATLAS results on Higgs boson couplings	After the discovery of the Higgs boson in summer 2012, the understanding of its properties has been a high priority of the ATLAS physics program. The couplings of the Higgs boson to other SM particles as well as to itself are measured or constrained in a variety of single and double Higgs boson production processes and decay channels. A selection of these analysis is presented in this talk, as well as the most recent combination results of both single and double Higgs boson measurements.	2019-08-24 06:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Higgs Physics		Reisaburo Tanaka	
222	Phase diagram and strange matter in SU(3) PNJL model	We discuss the phase diagram structure in the frame of the Polyakov loop extended NJL model. We consider the entanglement PNJL model and we consider how the modeling of axial anomaly can affect to phase diagram structure. We introduce the model with the constraits of strangeness neutrality and without it. We use the SU(3) PNJL model to show how the splitting of kaon mass can appear in dense matter and how it can affect the kaon to pion ratio. In the model we calculated the $K/\pi$ ratio of both positive and negative charged mesons along the chiral phase transition line to show how the peak position can depend on the phase diagram structure.		20 minutes	Oral Presentation			Alexandra Friesen	
223	Top quark physics with the ATLAS detector: recent highlights	The top quark is the heaviest known fundamental particle. As it is the only quark that decays before it hadronizes, it provides the unique opportunity to probe the properties of bare quarks at the Large Hadron Collider. This talk will present highlights of a few recent precision measurements of the top quark using 13 TeV collision data with the ATLAS experiment: top-quark pair and single top production cross sections, including differential distributions and production in association with bosons, will be presented alongside top quark properties measurements. Measurements of the top-quark mass and searches for rare top decays are also presented.	2019-08-28 09:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	LHC Semiplenary Session		Nello Bruscino	
224	Searches for electroweak production of supersymmetric particles with the ATLAS detector	Supersymmetry (SUSY) provides elegant solutions to several problems in the Standard Model, and searches for SUSY particles are an important component of the LHC physics program. The direct production of electroweak SUSY particles, such as sleptons, charginos, and neutralinos, is a particularly interesting area with connections to dark matter and the naturalness of the Higgs mass. This talk will present results from searches for electroweak SUSY partners using data collected with the ATLAS experiment in Run-2 at the LHC. Several signatures are employed, and the results of the searches interpreted as constraints on a variety of SUSY models.	2019-08-26 12:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel session on searches for SUSY		Ximo Poveda Torres	
226	Highlight on ATLAS physics results	Selected recent results from the ATLAS experiment will be hightlighted in the talk.

229	Techniques for the statistical combination of Higgs boson property measurements	Combinations of measurements play an important role in high-energy physics: they allow more precise determinations of quantities measured in complementary analyses, and yield new results that can only be obtained by using constraints from multiple sources. These combinations requires a careful statistical treatment. We review the methods and tools used in ATLAS for the combination targeting measurements of SM quantities or searches for new physics. We highlight in particular the methods used in the recent combination of measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates and the constraints on the Higgs boson coupling parameters.	2019-08-24 07:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Higgs Physics		Paolo Francavilla	
232	Quarkonia production with the STAR exeriment at RHIC	Quarkonia production with the STAR experiment at RHIC    Sonia Kabana on behalf of the STAR Collaboration    Quarkonia production is a crucial probe for the understanding of QCD and the identification and measurement of the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), produced in heavy ion collisions.    Quarkonia production and their transverse momentum dependence, as well as their dependence on charged multiplicity in p+p collisions give essential input to models towards understanding of their production and its relation to soft particle    production.    Quarkonia production in p+A and d+A collisions allow the    study of cold nuclear matter effects while all small systems p+p, p+A    and d+Au and light nuclei collisions contribute to our understanding of    quarkonia production in heavy A+A collisions.    .    Quarkonia production in collisions of heavy nuclei depends on a large    number of effects, among which feed down, nuclear absorption,    coalescence from c and cbar quarks at freeze out and dissociation via    color screening when their dissociation temperature is lower than the    temperature of the QGP phase.    As a consequence of the latter, the hierarchy of quarkonia suppression    has been proposed as a signature of the QGP phase also    allowing measurement of its Temperature.    In this talk we will show latest results on J/Psi and Upsilon production    in p+p collisions at 200 and 500 GeV, p+Au  and Au+Au collisions at 200     GeV from the STAR experiment at RHIC. In particular, for the small systems we will discuss an observed multiplicity dependence of the production whilein Au+Au collisions we will present the nuclear modification factor of J/Psi as well as of Upsilon from combined $\mu\mu$ and $ee$ channels.    The results will be compared to LHC data and to theoretical models.	2019-08-27 12:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Sonja Kabana	
233	ATLAS searches for di-Higgs production at 13 TeV and prospects for HL-LHC	The latest results on production of Higgs boson pairs at 13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment are reported, including  a combination of six different decay modes. Results include bbtautau, bbbb, bbgamgam, bbWW, WWWW and WWgamgam final states, and they are interpreted both in terms of sensitivity to the SM and as limits on kappa_lambda, a scaling of the triple-Higgs interaction strength. A new search dedicated to the Vector-Boson-Fusion production was performed in the bbbb final state. Future prospects of testing the Higgs self-couplings at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will also be presented.	2019-08-27 13:30:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Yuta Sano	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3537954/attachments/1895934/3127905/HH_summary_ysano_ICNFP2019_v3.pdf
234	Status of FAIR	The completion of the construction of the ESFRI landmark FAIR is the highest priority of the NuPECC Long Range Plan on the perspectives in Nuclear Physics.    The realization of the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research at Darmstadt, Germany has advanced significantly. The civil construction the Northern part of the building complex, including the SIS100 synchrotron tunnel is progressing well.    On site, at the GSI campus the upgrade of the existing accelerators, which will serve as injector chain for FAIR, has been completed. The series production of the components of the FAIR accelerator complex is ongoing. A large number of the superconducting SIS100 magnets has been produced and is accepted already. Major testing infrastructures for superconducting magnets have been set-up. The procurement of the components of all other FAIR accelerator systems is progressing well.    Also the construction of the experiment detector systems of the four research pillars of FAIR, APPA, CBM, NUSTAR and PANDA is ongoing. The schedule foresees the start of operation of the FAIR experiments in 2025.    Meanwhile the FAIR-Phase-0 experimental programme e.g. with the upgrades HADES detector is producing exciting data.    The progress of the realization of the FAIR facility and the prospects of its science will be presented.	2019-08-28 09:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC		Juergen Eschke	
237	Symmetry, Confinement, and the Higgs Phase	We point out a distinction, in gauge theories with matter in the fundamental representation, between color confinement and a stronger version of confinement, which we call “separation of charge” confinement.  The latter is a generalization of the Wilson area-law criterion to gauge+matter theories .  In gauge-Higgs theories, we show that the transition (which is not necessarily a thermodynamic transition) between separation-of-charge confinement and color confinement coincides with the spontaneous breaking of a certain global symmetry in the Higgs sector, known as custodial symmetry.	2019-08-22 09:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on QCD	Workshop on QCD	Jeff Greensite	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3535345/attachments/1895890/3127813/crete.pdf

These include the measurement of the electroweak mixing angle, the differential distributions and decay angular coefficient in Drell-Yan events, W mass related observables, trilinear gauge-couplings and electroweak production of one and two vector bosons in associaton with two jets.	2019-08-28 09:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	LHC Semiplenary Session		Vitaliano Ciulli	
241	NUCLEAR FEMTOGRAPHY AS A BRIDGE FROM THE NUCLEON TO NEUTRON STARS	The science of Nuclear Femtography probed by deeply virtual exclusive reactions has revolutionized our approach to exploring the internal structure of the nucleon by providing a tomographic reconstruction of both the quarks and gluons spatial density distributions and of their mechanical properties. A new generation of experiments pursuing nuclear femtography is being carried out at current facilities including Jefferson Lab. Nuclear femtography is also a central component in the planning of the future Electron Ion Collider (EIC). In particular, the internal pressure experienced by the quarks recently measured at Jefferson Lab, was found to be repulsive near the centre of the proton and of larger magnitude compared to the one in the interior of neutron stars. This result can be explained by introducing a QCD-based approach connecting the matrix elements of the QCD energy momentum tensor, describing the nucleon interior, with the neutron star's Equation of State in the high baryon density regime.		30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Lepton Nucleon Scattering Mini-workshop	Special session on Lepton-Nucleus scattering and Structure of the Nucleon	Simonetta Liuti	
242	The Nucleus as a QCD Laboratory	Inclusive deep inelastic scattering experiments have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) structure of nuclei and the effect of nuclear matter on the structure of hadrons. A great example is the observation by the European Muon Collaboration (EMC) of a deviation of the deep inelastic structure function of a nucleus from the sum of the structure functions of the free nucleons, the so-called EMC effect. On the theory side, despite decades of theoretical efforts with increased sophistication, a unifying physical picture of the origin of the EMC effect is still a matter of intense debate. To reach the next level of our understanding of nuclear QCD and unravel the partonic structure of nuclei, experiments need to go beyond the inclusive measurements and focus on exclusive and semi-inclusive reactions. The nucleus is the perfect laboratory for these studies. It plays a role of the detector when one studies quark propagation and hadronization in the nuclear medium. It also becomes the object of studies for understanding how quarks and gluons distributions are affected when they are embedded in nuclei compared to free nucleons. In this talk, results of the first exclusive measurement of deeply virtual Compton scattering off He-4 will be presented. Future measurements at Jefferson Lab 12 GeV will be discussed.	2019-08-22 08:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Lepton Nucleon Scattering Mini-workshop	Special session on Lepton-Nucleus scattering and Structure of the Nucleon	Kawtar Hafidi

244	QCD in the heavy dense regime for large Nc: on the existence of quarkyonic matter	During the last years it has become possible to address the cold and dense regime of QCD directly for    sufficiently heavy quarks, where combined strong coupling and hopping expansions are convergent and a    3d effective theory can be derived, which allows to control the sign problem either in simulations or by fully    analytic calculations. In this    contribution we review the effective theory and study the $N_c$-dependence of the nuclear liquid gas transition, as well as the equation of     state of baryonic matter.    We find the transition to become more strongly first order with growing $N_c$, suggesting that in the large    $N_c$ limit its critical endpoint moves to high temperatures to connect with the deconfinement transition. Furthermore,    to leading and next-to-leading order in the strong coupling and hopping expansions, respectively, the pressure is found    to scale as $p\sim N_c$, which is a defining property of quarkyonic matter.	2019-08-22 14:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on QCD		Owe Philipsen	
245	Precision Experiments at Heavy-Ion Storage Rings	The storage of freshly produced radioactive particles in a storage ring is a straightforward way to achieve the most efficient use of such rare species as it allows for using the same rare ion multiple times. Employing storage rings for precision physics experiments with highly-charged ions (HCI) at the intersection of atomic, nuclear, plasma and astrophysics is a rapidly developing field of research.     Until very recently, there were only two accelerator laboratories, GSI Helmholtz Center in Darmstadt, Germany (GSI) and Institute of Modern Physics in Lanzhou, China (IMP), operating such facilities. The experimental storage ring ESR at GSI and the experimental cooler-storage ring CSRe at IMP are able to store, cool and manipulate ions beams at energies of 400 A MeV, corresponding to b=0.6. The ESR is capable to slow down ion beams to as low as 4 A MeV (b=0.1).    Thanks to the fascinating results obtained at ESR and CSRe as well as to versatile experimental opportunities, there is now an increased attention to the research with ion-storage rings worldwide. Furthermore, experimental opportunities are being now dramatically enhanced through construction of dedicated low-energy storage rings, which enable stored and cooled secondary HCIs in previously inaccessible low-energy range. The first such facility, CRYRING, has just been constructed at GSI to receive decelerated beams of HCIs from ESR. Dedicated ring facilities are proposed for ISOLDE at CERN, TRIUMF, LANL, and JINR. In this contribution, some highlight research programs at present and future heavy-ion storage rings will be presented.	2019-08-22 06:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Physics of Exotic Nuclei		Yuri Litvinov

253	Overview of recent  STAR open heavy flavor measurements	The experiments at RHIC and LHC  have produced convincing evidence that strongly interacting partonic matter, Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), is created in central ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy ions.  Charm quarks are ideal probe of the QGP since they are dominantly produced in hard gluon-gluon interactions in early stages of nuclear collisions at RHIC energies. Therefore, they are sensitive to the whole evolution of the hot and dense matter. Thanks to the excellent vertex resolution provided by  the Heavy Flavor Tracker detector, STAR is able to measure charm quark production in multiple channels via reconstruction of hadronic decays of D0, D+/-,Ds and Lambda_c hadrons.  In this talk we will present recent STAR measurements of nuclear modification factors of D0 and  D+/- mesons,  D0 directed, elliptic and triangular flow and Ds/D0 and Lambda_c/D0 yield ratios. These measurements will be discussed in context of charm quark energy loss, charm quark transport in the QGP and final hadronization.	2019-08-27 10:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Jaroslav Bielcik	
256	The impact of fluctuations on the QCD phase structure	Low-energy QCD at finite temperatures and baryochemical densities predicts a phase transition from a chiral symmetry broken hadronic phase to a chirally restored quark-gluon plasma phase. In this talk the two and three quark flavor chiral phase structure with and without an axial U(1)-symmetry breaking is the major focus. The current status of low-energy QCD effective models is briefly summarized. Non-perturbative quantum fluctuations that are of particular importance in the vicinity of any phase transition are taken into account with the functional renormalization group method. The influence of vacuum and thermal fluctuations of quarks and mesons on the chiral phase structure is investigated in a systematic manner and confronted with corresponding mean-field approximations.	2019-08-22 08:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on QCD	Workshop on QCD	Bernd-Jochen Schaefer	https://indico.cern.ch/event/754973/contributions/3535343/attachments/1896067/3128168/creta_082019.pdf
257	ML techniques used in LHCb analyses and online applications	LHCb collaboration has been pioneering the employment of machine learning in real-time    computing, related to the high energy physic field (HEP), since 2015. The LHCb software trigger exploited a novel machine learning techniques based on binned boosted decision tree model that helped to select high-quality physics data in real-time. After that, a major modernisation of the algorithms for tracking, particle identification and offline physics selections using computing intelligence followed. Especially huge improvements of the background rejection factors for numerous physics analyses led to using the multivariate techniques as a standard step in obtaining clean signals within LHCb collaboration. In this presentation, we give a short overview of the tools and techniques based on the machine learning approach by LHCb experiment. We address the issues related to the proper selection of the training and verification data sets that are vital for the final results. One of the critical issues is to keep up with the rapid development of the tools, libraries and new ideas from outside of the HEP domain (mainly based on the ROOT package). Application of third-party software will be discussed through the application of a long-lived particles tracking algorithm that was commissioned and successfully operated during the second data taking a period of the LHCb experiment.	2019-08-28 12:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Machine Learning Session		Adam Mateusz Dendek

262	Branching of Center Vortices in SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory	The branching of center vortices in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in maximal center gauge is analyzed. When properly normalized, one can define a branching probability that turns out to be independent of the lattice spacing (in the limited scaling window studied here). The branching probability shows a rapid change at the deconfinement phase transition which is much more pronounced in space slices of the lattice as compared to time slices. Though not a strict order parameter (in the sense that it vanishes in one phase) the branching probability is thus found to be a reliable indicator for both the location of the critical temperature and the geometric re-arrangement of vortex matter across the deconfinement phase transition	2019-08-22 10:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on QCD	Workshop on QCD	Hugo Reinhardt	
265	Machine Learning tools for Physics Searches at the LHC	The LHC accelerator and experiments program have lead to rediscovering the Standard Model (SM) in the first months of data taking.    Machine learning techniques have been instrumental to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, and have become crucial in the following era.    On one side precision measurements require precise calibrations, on the other searches for rare SM processes and for beyond-SM processes require sifting to a huge amount of data in search for a very small signal. With these objectives, state-of-the-art machine learning techniques are being applied already.    The ongoing upgrade of the detectors in preparation of Run III also requires data acquisition systems to be prepared for very noisy data; studies for the integration of machine learning techniques in such systems (e.g. trigger), also in hardware-embedded form, are ongoing.    In this talk I will review the use of Machine Learning tools at the LHC, providing a state-of-the-art picture of the topic.	2019-08-28 12:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Machine Learning Session		Pietro Vischia, Pietro Vischia	
266	QCD phase diagram and baryon number fluctuations from DSEs	We present new results for fluctuations of the baryon number for QCD with    Nf=2+1 quark flavours at non-zero temperature and chemical potential [1].     These are extracted from a framework based on a combination of lattice QCD     and Dyson-Schwinger equations. In previous works ([2], see [3] for a review)     we found a critical end point in the region ($T^c,\mu_B^c$)=(120,500) MeV.      We discuss the changes of ratios of fluctuations up to fourth order along    and below the transition line for temperatures and baryon chemical potential     up to and beyond the critical end point.     Comparing with preliminary STAR data for the skewness and kurtosis ratios,     our results are compatible with the scenario of a critical end point at     large chemical potential and slightly offset from the freeze-out line.     We also discuss the caveats involved in this comparison.        [1] P.Isserstedt, M.Buballa, C.S.Fischer, P.Gunkel, arXiv:    [2] C.S.Fischer, J.Luecker and C.A.Welzbacher, Phys. Rev.

281	Searches for resonances in hadronic final states with the ATLAS detector	Many theories beyond the Standard Model predict new phenomena which decay to quarks.  Light-quarks are of particular interest at the LHC since new phenomena produced in parton collisions are likely to produce final states with (at least) two partons.  On the other hand, b- and top-quarks offer great potential to reduce the Standard Model background, although with significant challenges in reconstructing and identifying the decay products and modelling the remaining background.  Recent searches in various hadronic final states performed with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC on the 13 TeV data will be presented, along with some prospects for HL-LHC.	2019-08-27 12:00:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Trine Poulsen	
283	Chiral effects in rotating and accelerated medium	We consider a few theoretical issues related to the physics of heavy-ion collisions.    The emphasis is on predictions for microscopic variables, especially spin variables, and their dependence on the overall rotation and/or acceleration of the quark-gluon medium. In case of the rotation, as a manifestation of the low viscocity the central role is played by vortices. In case of the acceleration, we concentrate on the instability of the medium due to the Unruh effect.	2019-08-27 05:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Valentin Zakharov	
284	Non-Abelian Proca-Dirac-Higgs theory: particle-like solutions and their energy spectrum	We study a system consisting of a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ Proca field interacting with nonlinear scalar (Higgs) and spinor fields. For such a system, it is shown that particle-like solutions with finite energy do exist. It is demonstrated that the solutions depend on three free parameters of the system, including the central value of the scalar field $\phi_0$. For some fixed values of $\phi _0$, we find energy spectra of the solutions. It is shown that for each of the cases under consideration there is a minimum value of the energy $\Delta=\Delta(\phi_0)$  (the mass gap $\Delta(\phi_0)$ for a fixed value of $\phi_0$). The behavior of the function $\Delta(\phi_0)$  is studied for some range of  $\phi_0$.     We show that the energy spectrum has a minimum, at least for some values of $\phi_0$, and we argue that this will also take place for any value of $\phi_0$ lying in the range $0< \phi_0 <\infty$. The behaviour of this minimum as $\phi_0 \rightarrow \infty$ is of great interest: if in this limit the minimum is nonzero, one can say that there is a mass gap $\Delta \neq 0$ in non-Abelian Proca-Dirac-Higgs theory.    If such a mass gap does exist, this would be of great significance. The reason is that in quantum field theory there is a problem to prove the existence    of a mass gap in quantum  chromodynamics. This problem is highly nontrivial and any examples of its existence (even within a classical theory)    would be very useful for an understanding of the nature of existence of the mass gap.    If there is a mass gap in the theory we are investigating, it is possible that this is due to the fact that non-Abelian Proca-Dirac-Higgs theory is some approximation for nonperturbative quantization in QCD. In this case, it can be assumed that the Proca field describes a $SU(2)$ subgroup of $SU(3)$, the Higgs scalar field describes sea gluons and the Dirac nonlinear field describes sea quarks.    Thus, the purpose of the investigation is to (i) obtain particle-like solutions within a theory with a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ Proca field plus a Higgs scalar field plus a nonlinear Dirac field; (ii) study energy spectra of these solutions; and (iii) search for a minimum of the spectrum (a mass gap).

287	Lifshitz Regime and the phase diagram of QCD	We discuss dense cool QCD where a region with spatially inhomogeneous condensates may emerge. In that case, QCD phase diagram may exhibit a Lifshitz regime, which can appear either instead of, or in addition to Critical End Point. We study the Lifshitz regime using a combination of large-N expansion and numerical lattice simulations.	2019-08-22 12:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on QCD		Semeon Valgushev	
289	`Effective locality and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD’.	Some years ago, relying on standard functional manipulations, a new property of QCD fermionic Green’s functions has been put forth and called effective locality. This feature of QCD is non-perturbative, as resulting from a full integration of the gluons degrees of freedom. At least at quenching and a mild eikonal approximation, the relation of effective locality to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking will be examined. In particular interesting connections to Quark Flavour Dynamics will be discussed.	2019-08-22 15:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on QCD		Thierry Grandou

293	Search for rare and lepton flavor violating decays of the Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector	The Standard Model predicts several rare Higgs boson decay channels, which have not yet been observed, but that could be enhanced in theories beyond the Standard Model. Among these are decays to light leptons, e.g. $H \to\mu\mu$. In addition, theories beyond the Standard Model may predict lepton-flavor violating decays of the Higgs boson. Results for these searches based on pp collision data collected at 13 TeV will be presented.	2019-08-27 13:50:00+00:00	20 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Michaela Mlynarikova	
294	Lambda and antilambda hyperon polarization in heavy-ion collisions within transport model	$\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions at BES RHIC energies is studied within the microscopic transport model UrQMD. We trace the formation and space-time evolution of vorticity and helicity patterns in details. This study demands a complex analysis of the fireball conditions including time slices, extraction of temperature and baryo- and strangeness chemical potentials, as well as freeze-out conditions of both hyperons. Rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the polarization are obtained. We show that difference in global polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ at c.m. energies below 10 GeV can be explained by different space-time freeze-out conditions of two hyperons. Comparison with the STAR results shows a fair agreement between the model and the data.	2019-08-24 09:40:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Oleksandr Vitiuk

302	Higgs sector in the supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model with light sgoldstinos	We consider the generalization of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in some hidden sector. After all heavy fields from hidden sector are integrated out, only fields from SM, MSSM and goldstino multiplet remain in the model. We discuss the possibility of di-Higgs production amplification via process gg $\rightarrow$ s $\rightarrow$ hh with scalar particle sgoldstino, which is the superpartner of goldstino fermion. In this process sgoldstino is produced by gluon fusion and then decays to a pair of light neutral (SM) Higgs bosons. We observe two possible regimes of sgoldstino decays depending on parameter choice: domination of gluon decay mode and production of pairs of light neutral Higgs bosons, W-bosons and Z-bosons in relation 1:2:1. We give numerical estimates for borders of regions corresponding to these regimes in parameter space. We also obtain an upper limit for $M_3/F$ and a lower limit for $\sqrt{F}$ from experimental searches for heavy scalar resonances and determination of gluino mass made by the ATLAS and the CMS collaborations.	2019-08-27 12:25:00+00:00	25 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Ekaterina Kriukova	
305	A Quantum Multiparty Packing Lemma and the Relay Channel	Optimally encoding classical information in a quantum system is one of the oldest and most fundamental challenges of quantum information theory. Holevo's bound places a hard upper limit on such encodings, while the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland (HSW) theorem addresses the question of how many classical messages can be "packed" into a given quantum system. In this article, we use Sen's recent quantum joint typicality results to prove a one-shot multiparty quantum packing lemma generalizing the HSW theorem. The lemma is designed to be easily applicable in many network communication scenarios. As an illustration, we use it to straightforwardly obtain quantum generalizations of well-known classical coding schemes for the relay channel: multihop, coherent multihop, decode-forward, and partial decode-forward. We provide both finite blocklength and asymptotic results, the latter matching existing formulas. Given the key role of the classical packing lemma in network information theory, our packing lemma should help open the field to direct quantum generalization.	2019-08-28 12:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Parallel Session		Hrant Gharibyan

319	On the Phase Structure & Dynamics of QCD	In this talk recent progress on the phase structure of QCD and transport processes with the functional renormalisation group are reviewed. I present an update of the phase boundary that is in agreement with recnet lattice results. At larger density we also find indictations for an inhomgeneous phase as well as a critical end point.     The method is also used for the computation of transport coefficients such as the shear viscosity as well as general real-time correlation functions. This input is then used for computing flow coefficients, particles yields and fluctuation observables with QCD-assisted hydrodynamics and transport at finite temperature and density.	2019-08-22 13:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on QCD		Jan M.

323	Generalized and Extended Uncertainty Principles and their impact onto the Hawking radiation	I will briefly present the main ideas of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). Then, first I will discuss the impact of GUP onto the Bekenstein entropy and the Hawking temperature and show how GUP influences the Hawking radiation leaving a remnant of a radiating black hole. I will also show that when GUP is applied, the Hawking radiation does not necessarily have to be sparse when a black hole approaches the Planck mass. Finally, I will present the influence of EUP on the Bekenstein entropy and the Hawking radiation for Rindler and cosmological spacetimes. Some interesting relations between black hole thermodynamics and the principle of maximum tension will also be uncovered.	2019-08-28 08:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on New physics paradigms after Higgs and gravitational wave discoveries		Mariusz Dabrowski

328	Some aspects of the cooling of neutron stars	Measurements of the low masses for the pulsar PSR J0737-3039B, for the    companion of PSR J1756-2251 and for the companion of PSR J0453+1559 on the one    hand and of the high masses for the pulsars PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348-0432 on    the other demonstrate the existence of compact stars with masses in a broad range    from 1.2 to 2 Msun .  We show that for realistic  stellar matter EoS it is possible to explain  the  whole set of cooling data within "nuclear medium cooling" scenario for compact stars by a variation of the star masses. We select appropriate proton gap profiles from those exploited in the literature and allow for a variation of the effective pion gap controlling the efficiency of the medium modified Urca process.    Using the set of existing observational  temperature-age data for neutron stars one can also extract their possible mass distribution  from the cooling model, because for each of observed compact object its mass can be predicted from the model. Such analyses has been performed for a particular EoS  -  DD2 model and shown that indeed the interval of masses from 1.2 to 2 Msun  should be equally populated.	2019-08-28 09:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity		Hovik Grigorian	
330	Hall conductivity as the topological invariant in  phase space	It is well known that in the absence of interactions the quantum Hall (QHE) conductivity in the presence of constant magnetic field is expressed through the topological TKNN invariant. The same invariant is responsible for the intrinsic anomalous quantum Hall effect (AQHE), which, in addition, may be represented as one in momentum space composed of the two point Green function. We propose the generalization of this expression to the QHE in the presence of non-uniform magnetic field. The proposed expression is the topological invariant in phase space composed of the Wigner transformation of the two-point Green function. It is applicable to a wide range of non-uniform tight-binding models, including the interacting ones.	2019-08-26 07:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Lattice and Condensed Matter Physics		Ignat Fialkovskiy	
331	Effects of turbulent mixing and static noise in Hwa-Kardar model of self-organised criticality	The Hwa-Kardar model of self-organised criticality is studied by the renormalization group analysis. The noise in the model under consideration is quenched, i.e., Gaussian one with correlation function $\left\langle ff\right\rangle\propto\delta^{(d)} ({\bf x-x'})$, where both ${\bf x}$ and ${\bf x}'$ are spatial coordinates and no dependence on time is presented. The effects of turbulent motion of the environment are taken into account. The advecting velocity field is described by Gaussian ensemble with finite correlation time.    Critical exponents are calculated in one-loop approximation. We show that depending on the relation between the exponent describing scaling behavior of the velocity field and the spatial dimension $d$, the system reveals different types of large-scale, long-time scaling behaviour, associated with the possible fixed points of the renormalization group equations.	2019-08-26 15:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Heavy Ion Physics		Nikolay Gulitskiy	
332	The spatial sub-separation of strangeness from non strangeness in heavy-ion collisions at energies of FAIR and NICA	The heavy-ion collisions at energies of FAIR and NICA are studied within the microscopic transport models. The whole interaction area is subdivided into the smaller cells. We perform the analysis of the space-time evolution of all particles in all cells, in the T-mu_B and T-mu_S planes, and the analysis in x-t of the finally emitted strange and non-strange particles.    Following the time evolution of both distributions, we clearly see the spacial separation of strangeness from anti-strangeness, as well as earlier freeze-out times of kaons and pions compared to those of protons and Lambdas. The latter appear to be frozen out at lower temperature and larger strangeness chemical potential.	2019-08-28 14:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Physics at FAIR-NICA-SPS-BES/RHIC		Larisa Bravina	
334	Bayesian Analysis for Extracting Properties of the Nuclear  Equation of State	We perform a Bayesian analysis for selecting the most probable     equation of state under a set of constraints from compact star physics,     which now include the tidal deformability from GW170817. For the first     time it was considered a two-parameter family of hybrid equations of     state that is based on realistic models for the hadronic phase     (KVORcut02) and the quark matter phase (SFM) which produce a third     family of hybrid stars in the mass-radius diagram. We present the     corresponding results for compact star properties like mass, radius and     tidal deformabilities and use empirical data for them in Bayesian     analysis method to obtain the probabilities for the model parameters     within their considered range.	2019-08-28 10:00:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Astro-Cosmo-Gravity		Alexander Ayriyan

Yoshimoto, T. Zhang and Q. Zhao,     The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams in Michigan State University includes a continuous wave (CW) superconducting (SC) driver linac capable to accelerate any ion beam from oxygen to uranium above 200 MeV/u. The first segment of the FRIB linac, composed of 15 cryomodules, was successfully commissioned with beam. Detailed study of the beam parameters demonstrated good consistency with the original design parameters. Four ion beam species, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe, were accelerated up to 20.3 MeV/u with 100% transmission and no detectable beam losses. High-power equivalent beams were delivered to the beam dump in two modes: pulsed and CW. In pulsed mode, the peak intensity of argon beam was 14.8 pA at 3% duty factor which constitutes 30% of the FRIB design intensity for this particular ion beam. A CW argon beam was accelerated, demonstrating that the FRIB linac in its current configuration is the highest energy CW SC hadron linac in the world.    *Work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science under Cooperative Agreement DE-SC0000661, the State of Michigan and Michigan State University.	2019-08-22 09:30:00+00:00	30 minutes	Oral Presentation	Workshop on Physics of Exotic Nuclei		Peter Ostroumov
